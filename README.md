# About Me

## Introduction
ðŸ‘‹ Hello, everyone! My name is Birendra, and I'm delighted to share a bit about myself with you. I am currently pursuing my IT degree in BSc. (Hons) Computing from London Metropolitan University. Alongside my studies, I am actively working as a front-end developer, where I get to bring beautiful designs to life through code.

## Interests
ðŸŒŸ While front-end development is my primary focus, I have a strong passion for exploring various fields within the vast realm of technology. Two areas that particularly captivate my interest are Game Development and Machine Learning. I find the process of creating immersive gaming experiences exhilarating and am keen to dive deeper into the intricacies of game design and development. Additionally, the potential of Machine Learning to transform industries and solve complex problems fascinates me, and I am actively expanding my knowledge in this area.

## Skills
ðŸ”§ Here are some of the skills I have acquired so far:

- **Front-End Development:** I have solid experience in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, which allows me to craft responsive and visually appealing websites. I am familiar with modern frameworks like React and Angular, enabling me to build dynamic and interactive user interfaces.

- **Game Development:** Although still in the early stages of my journey in game development, I have been working with tools such as Unity and Unreal Engine to create small games. I am excited to continue learning and expanding my expertise in this exciting field.

- **Machine Learning:** While I am in the process of acquiring knowledge in machine learning, I have a good foundation in Python and have completed courses that cover fundamental machine learning concepts. I am eager to delve deeper into this field and contribute to its growth.
